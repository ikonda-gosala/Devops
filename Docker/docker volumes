Docker volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated and used by Docker containers. Unlike the containerâ€™s writable layer, data in volumes 
is not deleted when the container stops or is removed, making them ideal for storing databases, logs, or user-generated content.

ðŸ§± Why Use Docker Volumes?
Persistence: Keeps data even if the container is deleted.
Sharing: Can be shared between multiple containers.
Isolation: Keeps data separate from the container image.
Performance: Optimized for I/O operations compared to bind mounts.
  
ðŸ“¦ Types of Docker Storage
Volumes ---->	Managed by Docker, stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/
Bind ------> Mounts	Maps a host directory to a container path
tmpfs	------->Temporary storage in memory (Linux only)
